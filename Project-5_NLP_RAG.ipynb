       "[Document(page_content='Chapter 124. Principles of Cancer Therapy\\nIntroduction\\nCuring cancer requires eliminating all cancer cells. The major modalities of therapy are\\n• Surgery and radiation therapy (for local and local-regional disease)\\n• Chemotherapy (for systemic disease) Other important methods include\\n• Hormonal therapy (for selected cancers, eg, prostate, breast, endometrium)\\n• Immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies, interferons, and other biologic response modifiers and tumor\\nvaccines—see p. 1059)\\n• Differentiating agents such as retinoids\\n• Targeted agents that exploit the growing knowledge of cellular and molecular biology\\nOverall treatment should be coordinated among a radiation oncologist, surgeon, and medical oncologist,\\nwhere appropriate. Choice of modalities constantly evolves, and numerous controlled research trials\\ncontinue. When available and appropriate, clinical trial participation should be considered and discussed\\nwith patients.\\nVarious terms are used to describe the response to treatment (see\\nTable 124-1). The disease-free interval often serves as an indicator of cure and varies with cancer type.\\nFor example, lung, colon, bladder, and testicular cancers are usually cured if a 5-yr disease-free interval\\noccurs. However, breast cancer may recur even after 5 yr; thus a 10-yr disease-free interval is more\\nindicative of cure.\\nTreatment decisions should weigh the likelihood of adverse effects against the likelihood of benefit; these\\ndecisions require frank communication and possibly the involvement of a multidisciplinary cancer team.\\nPatient preferences for how to live out the end of life should be established early in the course of cancer\\n[Table 124-1. Defining Response to Cancer Treatment]\\ntreatment despite the difficulties of discussing death at such a sensitive time (see p. 3471).\\nModalities of Cancer Therapy\\nTreatment of cancer can involve any of several modalities:\\n• Surgery\\n• Radiation therapy\\n• Chemotherapy\\nOften, modalities are combined to create a program that is appropriate for the patient and is based on\\npatient and tumor characteristics as well as patient preferences.\\nSurvival rates with the different modalities, alone and in combination, are listed for selected cancers (see\\nTable 124-2).\\nSurgery\\nSurgery is the oldest form of effective cancer therapy.

       " Document(page_content=\"Chapter 292. Pediatric Cancers\\nIntroduction\\nOverall, childhood cancer is relatively rare, with fewer than 11,000 cases and about 1,500 deaths\\nannually among children aged 0 to 14 yr. In comparison, there are 1.4 million cases and 565,000 deaths\\nannually among adults. However, cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death among children, following only\\ninjuries.\\nChildhood cancers include many that also occur in adults. Leukemia (see p. 1004) is by far the most\\ncommon, representing about 33% of childhood cancers, brain tumors represent about 21%, lymphomas\\n(see p. 1016) about 8%, and certain bone cancers (osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma—see p. 407)\\nabout 4%. Cancers that are exclusive to children include neuroblastoma (7% of cases), Wilms' tumor\\n(5%), rhabdomyosarcoma (3 to 4%), and retinoblastoma (3%).\\nChildren who survive cancer have more years than adults to develop long-term consequences of\\nchemotherapy and radiation therapy, which include\\n• Infertility\\n• Poor growth\\n• Cardiac damage\\n• Development of second cancers (in 3 to 12% of survivors)\\nConsensus guidelines on screening for and management of long-term consequences are available from\\nthe Children's Oncology Group at www.survivorshipguidelines.org/.\\nBecause of the severe consequences and complexity of treatment, children with cancer are best treated\\nin centers with expertise in childhood cancers.\\nThe impact of being diagnosed with cancer and the intensity of the treatment are overwhelming to the\\nchild and family. Maintaining a sense of normalcy for the child is difficult, especially given the need for\\nfrequent hospitalizations and outpatient visits and potentially painful procedures. Overwhelming stress is\\ntypical, as parents struggle to continue to work, be attentive to siblings, and still attend to the many needs\\nof the child with cancer. The situation is even more difficult when the child is being treated at a specialty\\ncenter far from home.\\nBrain Tumors\\nBrain tumors are the most common solid cancer in children < 15 yr and are the 2nd leading\\ncause of death due to cancer. Diagnosis is typically by imaging (usually MRI) and biopsy.\\nTreatment may include surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.\", metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': 'D:20120615054440Z', 'creator': 'Atop CHM to PDF Converter', 'file_path': '/content/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': 'D:20250726172137Z', 'page': 3110, 'producer': 'pdf-lib (https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)', 'source': '/content/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': 'The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition', 'total_pages': 4114, 'trapped': ''}),\n",
